[h1]This plugin is a part of upcoming "Endless Sky: Captain's Edition" reboot of the base game. Stay tuned - meanwhile, installing the plugins can help to preview the experience, together or in parts.[/h1]

This is version with less disruptive, slower animations. Non-living ships made looks less organic/making breath-like motions. Living ships made look even more organic/making breath-like motions ;)

[h1]Features[/h1]

[list][*]Every ship has been separately and carefully tweaked for best looking effect in-game.

[*]Unlike upstream, new ship sprites from Endless Sky 0.9.10+ are no longer replaced by animated version of old ones.[/list]

[*]All ships have a matching high-DPI version, generated from the source material via on-GPU upscale through neural network, trained specifically on "Endless Sky" ship sprites.

[*]Most animations were tweaked by hand, to get rid of minor glitches (like objects clipping through objects).




[h1]Installing[/h1]

Check:
https://github.com/Cat-Lady/undisruptive-animated-ships/releases

...for latest, pre-packaged version.


[b]1.[/b] Unpack [i]undisruptive-animated-ship[/i] to your ES plugins folder. Be sure that you have single [i]bundisruptive-animated-ship[/i] directory inside your plugins folder, containing [i]data[/i] and [i]images[/i] folders. Directory structure should look like:

[code](...)/undisruptive-animated-ship/(.../data/, /images/ and other stuff)[/code]

It [b]won't[/b] work if the directory structure will be anything like:

[code](...)/plugins/undisruptive-animated-ship/undisruptive-animated-ship/(...)[/code]

[b]Warning:[/b]
This plugin doesn't work with ships purchased before the plugin installation, unless save game is edited (one-time fix) so that ships declared in save file are modified to have "sprite" section matching one in the plugin (see plugin's [i]/data/ships.txt[/i] for syntax).
