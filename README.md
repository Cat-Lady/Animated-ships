# Animated-ships
IMPORTANT: 
Some people had troubles installing the mod since most times the file is unzipped as plugins/the-animated-ships-master/The animated ships; to work correctly it must be just plugins/The animated ships

Note: this plugin doesn't add lightning, but proper 3d movements of ships part.

Have you ever looked at the ships flying around your flagship and thought that they looked a bit boring? Well, thanks to ths plugin,now you won't never have that feeling any more! This mod to the game Endless sky adds animation to 19 human ships, every Sestor, Mereti, Remnant (0.99 ships as well), Hai (0.99 ships as well), Pug T1 ships, the Chaser, the Deep River and the World-Ship a.

It also adds animations to some of the ships of the plugin of @darcman99, "Adde"

Second note: this plugin doesn't work with ships purchased before the plugin installation, unless with editing the ship's attribute
