# Undisruptive Animated Ships

This is version with less disruptive, slower animations. Non-living ships made looks less organic/making breath-like motions. Living ships made look even more organic/making breath-like motions ;)





## Features
- Every ship has been separately and carefully tweaked for best effect.

- New ship sprites from Endless Sky 0.9.10+ are no longer replaced by animated version of old ones.



### Installing

Check:
https://github.com/Cat-Lady/undisruptive-animated-ships/releases
...for latest, pre-packaged version.

Unpack to your ES plugins folder. Be sure that you have single ``undisruptive-animated-ships`` directory inside your plugin folder, containing ``data`` and ``images`` directories - it **won't** work if the directory structure will be anything like:
```(...)/plugins/undisruptive-animated-ships/undisruptive-animated-ships/(...)```

Warning:
This plugin doesn't work with ships purchased before the plugin installation, unless save game is edited (one-time fix) so that ships declared in save are fixed for having its "sprite" section matching the one in the plugin (see plugin's ```/data/ships.txt```).
